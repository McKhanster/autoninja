# E2E Test Readiness Audit Requirements

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for auditing and ensuring the AutoNinja system is ready for comprehensive end-to-end testing. The audit focuses on verifying that all agents implement proper rate limiting, persistence, orchestration flow, and deployment validation to ensure a successful test where the system deploys a working agent to CloudFormation without errors.

## Glossary

- **AutoNinja System**: The multi-agent orchestration system consisting of supervisor and 5 collaborator agents
- **Supervisor Agent**: The orchestrating agent that manages the sequential execution of collaborator agents
- **Collaborator Agents**: The 5 specialized agents (requirements-analyst, code-generator, solution-architect, quality-validator, deployment-manager)
- **AgentCore Memory**: AWS AgentCore service for distributed memory and state management
- **Global Rate Limiter**: System-wide rate limiting mechanism enforcing 30-second intervals between model invocations
- **E2E Test**: End-to-end test that validates complete system functionality from user request to deployed agent
- **Job Name**: Unique identifier for each orchestration run (format: job-{keyword}-{YYYYMMDD}-{HHMMSS})
- **Inference Record**: DynamoDB record containing request/response data for each agent invocation
- **Artifact**: S3-stored output from each agent phase (requirements, code, architecture, validation, deployment)

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Global Rate Limiting Compliance

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all agents to respect the global 30-second rate limiting rule, so that the system avoids throttling and operates within AWS service limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any agent invokes a foundation model, THE Global_Rate_Limiter SHALL enforce a minimum 30-second interval since the last model invocation by any agent
2. WHEN the Supervisor_Agent checks rate limits, THE AgentCore_Memory SHALL return the timestamp of the last model invocation across all agents
3. WHEN an agent updates rate limit state, THE AgentCore_Memory SHALL store the current timestamp and agent identifier
4. WHEN multiple agents attempt concurrent model invocations, THE Global_Rate_Limiter SHALL serialize access with proper waiting periods
5. WHEN rate limit enforcement fails, THE System SHALL log the error and continue with a default wait period

### Requirement 2: Supervisor Rate Limiting Implementation

**User Story:** As a system architect, I want the supervisor's rate limiting feature to correctly store and retrieve memory state, so that global coordination works properly across all agents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Supervisor_Agent initializes, THE AgentCore_Memory SHALL be configured with the correct memory ID and namespace
2. WHEN the Supervisor_Agent checks rate limits, THE System SHALL retrieve memory records from the "/rate-limiting/global" namespace
3. WHEN the Supervisor_Agent updates rate limits, THE System SHALL create events in AgentCore_Memory with proper actor and session IDs
4. WHEN AgentCore_Memory operations fail, THE Supervisor_Agent SHALL handle errors gracefully and log failure details
5. WHEN rate limit data is corrupted or missing, THE System SHALL initialize with safe defaults

### Requirement 3: Sequential Agent Orchestration

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want the supervisor to proceed to the next agent only after the current agent completes its actions, so that the orchestration follows the correct sequence and dependencies.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Supervisor_Agent starts orchestration, THE System SHALL invoke agents in the exact sequence: requirements-analyst, code-generator, solution-architect, quality-validator, deployment-manager
2. WHEN an agent completes successfully, THE Supervisor_Agent SHALL wait for all outputs to be persisted before proceeding to the next agent
3. WHEN an agent fails, THE Supervisor_Agent SHALL halt orchestration and return error details
4. WHEN the quality-validator returns invalid results, THE Supervisor_Agent SHALL skip deployment-manager and return validation failure
5. WHEN all agents complete successfully, THE Supervisor_Agent SHALL return the final deployment results

### Requirement 4: Universal Persistence Implementation

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want every agent to save requests and responses to DynamoDB, so that complete audit trails are maintained for all system operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any agent receives a request, THE Agent SHALL immediately log the input to DynamoDB with job_name, timestamp, and full request data
2. WHEN any agent completes processing, THE Agent SHALL update the DynamoDB record with response data, duration, and status
3. WHEN any agent encounters an error, THE Agent SHALL log error details to DynamoDB with failure timestamp and error message
4. WHEN DynamoDB operations fail, THE Agent SHALL log the persistence failure but continue processing
5. WHEN querying DynamoDB records, THE System SHALL return complete request/response pairs for each agent invocation

### Requirement 5: Comprehensive Artifact Storage

**User Story:** As a system auditor, I want all artifacts to be stored in S3 with proper organization, so that complete outputs from each phase are preserved and accessible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any agent produces output, THE Agent SHALL save both raw responses and processed artifacts to S3
2. WHEN storing artifacts, THE System SHALL use the structure: {job_name}/{phase}/{agent_name}/{filename}
3. WHEN artifacts are saved, THE System SHALL use proper content types and server-side encryption
4. WHEN S3 operations fail, THE Agent SHALL retry once and log failure details if unsuccessful
5. WHEN listing artifacts, THE System SHALL return complete metadata including S3 URIs and file sizes

### Requirement 6: Individual Agent Rate Limiting

**User Story:** As a system developer, I want each individual agent to implement proper rate limiting and logging, so that all agents follow consistent patterns and contribute to system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any Collaborator_Agent starts processing, THE Agent SHALL call enforce_rate_limit_before_call with its agent name
2. WHEN any Collaborator_Agent makes model invocations, THE Agent SHALL respect the global rate limiting mechanism
3. WHEN any Collaborator_Agent completes actions, THE Agent SHALL log structured messages with job context
4. WHEN any Collaborator_Agent encounters rate limiting, THE Agent SHALL wait the required duration before proceeding
5. WHEN rate limiting fails for any agent, THE Agent SHALL log the error and continue with safe defaults

### Requirement 7: Deployment Validation Success Criteria

**User Story:** As a quality assurance engineer, I want the test to validate successful agent deployment to CloudFormation, so that the end-to-end process proves the system can deliver working solutions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the E2E_Test completes successfully, THE Deployment_Manager SHALL have created a valid CloudFormation template
2. WHEN deployment validation runs, THE System SHALL verify the CloudFormation stack deploys without errors
3. WHEN the deployed agent is tested, THE System SHALL confirm the agent responds to invocations correctly
4. WHEN all validation passes, THE E2E_Test SHALL return success status with deployed agent ARN
5. WHEN any deployment step fails, THE System SHALL provide detailed error information for troubleshooting

### Requirement 8: Comprehensive Test Coverage

**User Story:** As a test engineer, I want the E2E test to verify all critical system components, so that test success indicates full system readiness.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the E2E_Test runs, THE Test SHALL verify supervisor invocation completes successfully
2. WHEN verifying logs, THE Test SHALL confirm CloudWatch contains entries for supervisor and all collaborator agents
3. WHEN checking persistence, THE Test SHALL validate DynamoDB contains complete request/response records for all agents
4. WHEN validating artifacts, THE Test SHALL confirm S3 contains outputs from all phases with proper organization
5. WHEN all verifications pass, THE Test SHALL report comprehensive success metrics and job details
