# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for deploying AutoNinja's complete infrastructure to AWS, including a simple React frontend dashboard, AWS CodeCommit repository migration, and CI/CD pipeline. The deployment prioritizes simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and functionality in the us-east-2 region.

## Glossary

- **AutoNinja_System**: The complete multi-agent Bedrock system including backend Lambda functions, agents, and infrastructure
- **Frontend_Dashboard**: A simple React-based web application with password authentication and dashboard interface
- **CodeCommit_Repository**: AWS-managed Git repository hosting the AutoNinja codebase
- **CI_CD_Pipeline**: Automated build and deployment pipeline using AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild
- **CloudFormation_Stack**: Infrastructure as Code template defining all AWS resources
- **S3_Static_Hosting**: Amazon S3 bucket configured for static website hosting
- **CloudFront_Distribution**: AWS CloudFront CDN for serving the frontend application
- **Amplify_App**: AWS Amplify application for simplified frontend deployment (alternative to S3+CloudFront)
- **Build_Artifact**: Compiled React application ready for deployment

3. WHEN a user enters the correct password, THE Frontend_Dashboard SHALL display the main dashboard interface
4. THE Frontend_Dashboard SHALL be located in a "frontend" directory at the project root
5. THE Frontend_Dashboard SHALL use minimal dependencies to reduce complexity
6. THE Frontend_Dashboard SHALL include a package.json file with build scripts
7. THE Frontend_Dashboard SHALL generate a Build_Artifact in a "build" or "dist" directory

### Requirement 3: Cost-Optimized Frontend Hosting

**User Story:** As a project owner, I want the cheapest AWS hosting solution for the frontend, so that I can minimize operational costs

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE AutoNinja_System SHALL deploy the Frontend_Dashboard using AWS Amplify Hosting
2. THE CloudFormation_Stack SHALL define the Amplify_App resource with manual deployment configuration
3. THE Amplify_App SHALL be configured in the us-east-2 region
4. THE CloudFormation_Stack SHALL output the Amplify_App URL for accessing the frontend
5. IF Amplify is not suitable, THEN THE AutoNinja_System SHALL use S3_Static_Hosting with CloudFront_Distribution as an alternative

### Requirement 4: Frontend Infrastructure as Code

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want CloudFormation templates for frontend infrastructure, so that I can deploy and manage resources consistently

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE AutoNinja_System SHALL create a CloudFormation template named "frontend-infrastructure.yaml"
2. THE CloudFormation_Stack SHALL define the Amplify_App resource with required properties
3. THE CloudFormation_Stack SHALL include IAM roles with least-privilege permissions for Amplify
4. THE CloudFormation_Stack SHALL define outputs including the frontend URL
5. THE CloudFormation_Stack SHALL be located in "infrastructure/cloudformation/stacks/" directory
6. THE CloudFormation_Stack SHALL accept parameters for Environment and BranchName

### Requirement 5: CodeCommit Repository Migration

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the codebase migrated to AWS CodeCommit, so that all project resources are hosted on AWS

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE AutoNinja_System SHALL create a CloudFormation template for the CodeCommit_Repository
2. THE CodeCommit_Repository SHALL be named "autoninja-bedrock-agents"
3. THE CodeCommit_Repository SHALL be created in the us-east-2 region
4. THE CloudFormation_Stack SHALL include a repository description
5. THE CloudFormation_Stack SHALL output the CodeCommit clone URL (HTTPS and SSH)
6. THE CloudFormation_Stack SHALL define IAM policies for repository access

### Requirement 6: CI/CD Pipeline Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want automated CI/CD pipelines, so that code changes are automatically built and deployed

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE CI_CD_Pipeline SHALL use AWS CodePipeline as the orchestration service
2. THE CI_CD_Pipeline SHALL use AWS CodeBuild for build execution
3. WHEN code is pushed to the CodeCommit_Repository, THE CI_CD_Pipeline SHALL trigger automatically
4. THE CI_CD_Pipeline SHALL include stages for Source, Build, and Deploy
5. THE CI_CD_Pipeline SHALL build the Frontend_Dashboard and deploy to Amplify_App
6. THE CI_CD_Pipeline SHALL deploy backend CloudFormation_Stack updates
7. THE CloudFormation_Stack SHALL define the CodePipeline resource with all stages
8. THE CloudFormation_Stack SHALL define CodeBuild projects for frontend and backend builds

### Requirement 7: Build Specifications

**User Story:** As a build engineer, I want CodeBuild buildspec files, so that builds execute correctly and consistently

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE AutoNinja_System SHALL create a buildspec.yml file for frontend builds
2. THE buildspec.yml SHALL install Node.js dependencies
3. THE buildspec.yml SHALL execute the React build command
4. THE buildspec.yml SHALL output Build_Artifact to the correct directory
5. THE AutoNinja_System SHALL create a buildspec-backend.yml file for backend deployments
6. THE buildspec-backend.yml SHALL package Lambda functions
7. THE buildspec-backend.yml SHALL deploy CloudFormation_Stack updates

### Requirement 8: Regional Configuration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want all resources deployed to us-east-2, so that resources are co-located for optimal performance

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE CloudFormation_Stack SHALL deploy all resources to the us-east-2 region
2. THE CodeCommit_Repository SHALL be created in us-east-2
3. THE Amplify_App SHALL be configured for us-east-2
4. THE CI_CD_Pipeline SHALL execute in us-east-2
5. THE CloudFormation_Stack SHALL include region validation

### Requirement 9: Simplified Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer with limited time, I want the simplest possible implementation, so that deployment is completed quickly

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Frontend_Dashboard SHALL use Create React App or Vite for project scaffolding
2. THE Frontend_Dashboard SHALL avoid complex state management libraries
3. THE Frontend_Dashboard SHALL use inline styles or minimal CSS
