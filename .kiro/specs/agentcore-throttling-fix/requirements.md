# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This spec addresses two critical issues for the AutoNinja hackathon submission:

1. **AgentCore Implementation**: The hackathon requires using Amazon Bedrock AgentCore (at least 1 primitive), but the current implementation uses standard Bedrock Agents with CloudFormation-based supervisor
2. **Throttling Issues**: The system is experiencing `throttlingException` errors during testing, preventing successful agent invocation

The hackathon deadline is approaching, and both issues must be resolved to meet the submission requirements and demonstrate a working system.

## Glossary

- **AgentCore**: Amazon Bedrock AgentCore runtime environment for deploying containerized AI agents
- **Supervisor_Agent**: The orchestrating agent that coordinates 5 collaborator agents
- **Collaborator_Agents**: The 5 specialized agents (Requirements Analyst, Code Generator, Solution Architect, Quality Validator, Deployment Manager)
- **Throttling_Exception**: AWS error indicating request rate limits have been exceeded
- **Rate_Limiter**: DynamoDB-based mechanism to control request frequency

## Requirements

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the enhanced architecture is implemented THEN the 5 collaborator agents SHALL remain as standard Bedrock Agents
2. WHEN AgentCore capabilities are added THEN they SHALL be implemented via CloudFormation resources (AWS::BedrockAgentCore::Memory and AWS::BedrockAgentCore::Runtime)

5. WHEN the CloudFormation template is updated THEN it SHALL add AgentCore Memory and Runtime resources alongside existing supervisor
6. WHEN the CloudFormation template is updated THEN it SHALL add AgentCore-specific outputs and IAM permissions

8. WHEN the system is tested THEN the end-to-end workflow SHALL work with AgentCore Memory-based rate limiting
9. WHEN the enhanced supervisor operates THEN it SHALL have access to AgentCore Memory, DynamoDB, and S3 resources
10. WHEN the system is documented THEN it SHALL clearly explain the AgentCore enhancement approach

### Requirement 4: Rate Limiting Enhancement

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want enhanced rate limiting mechanisms, so that the system can handle high loads without exceeding AWS service limits.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the rate limiter is implemented THEN it SHALL use AgentCore Memory for distributed rate limiting across ALL agents including the supervisor
2. WHEN checking rate limits THEN the system SHALL query AgentCore Memory for the last model invocation timestamp for ANY agent (including supervisor)
3. WHEN enforcing rate limits THEN the system SHALL wait if the minimum 30-second interval has not elapsed since ANY model invocation
4. WHEN the supervisor makes its own model invocations THEN it SHALL record its invocation timestamp in AgentCore Memory and respect the 30-second limit
5. WHEN multiple instances run THEN the rate limiter SHALL work correctly across distributed deployments using AgentCore Memory
6. WHEN the rate limiter stores data THEN it SHALL use AgentCore Memory's built-in consistency and expiry features
7. WHEN rate limiting is active THEN it SHALL log wait times and throttling events for ALL agents
8. WHEN the system scales THEN the rate limiter SHALL maintain consistent behavior through AgentCore Memory
9. WHEN rate limits are configured THEN they SHALL be adjustable via environment variables but default to 30 seconds minimum
