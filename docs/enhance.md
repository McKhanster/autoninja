Comprehensive Plan: Leveraging Advanced Bedrock Features for Production-Ready Agent Generation
Based on my research of Bedrock's advanced capabilities, here's my plan to transform AutoNinja from basic hardcoded logic to a sophisticated AI agent generation system:

Current State Analysis
❌ Current Issues:
Hardcoded Logic: Agents use basic string templates instead of AI reasoning
Poor Artifact Quality: Generated CloudFormation templates are minimal, Lambda code is generic
No Knowledge Integration: No use of Knowledge Bases for best practices
Basic Prompts: Simple instructions without structured reasoning
Missing Bedrock Features: Not leveraging Flows, Prompt Management, or advanced orchestration
✅ What Works:
Direct Lambda orchestration with rate limiting
S3 artifact persistence
DynamoDB logging
Real CloudFormation deployment (newly implemented)
Improvement Strategy: Leveraging Advanced Bedrock Features
1. Prompt Engineering Revolution
Replace hardcoded logic with sophisticated AI reasoning:

Requirements Analyst Enhancement:
Current: Basic string extraction
New: Structured analysis framework with:
Business context understanding
Technical feasibility assessment
Compliance requirement identification
User journey mapping
Success criteria definition
Solution Architect Enhancement:
Current: Generic AWS service selection
New: Architecture reasoning with:
Well-Architected Framework principles
Cost optimization analysis
Security-first design
Scalability planning
Service integration patterns
Code Generator Enhancement:
Current: Template-based code generation
New: Production-ready code with:
Error handling and logging
Security best practices
Performance optimization
Testing frameworks
Documentation generation
2. Knowledge Base Integration
Add domain expertise through Knowledge Bases:

AWS Best Practices KB:
Well-Architected Framework documents
Security best practices
Cost optimization guides
Service integration patterns
Code Templates KB:
Production Lambda patterns
Bedrock Agent configurations
CloudFormation templates
OpenAPI specifications
Agent Patterns KB:
Common agent use cases
Conversation flows
Error handling patterns
Testing strategies
3. Bedrock Flows for Complex Workflows
Replace linear orchestration with intelligent flows:

Requirements Analysis Flow:
User Request → Context Analysis → Requirement Extraction → 
Feasibility Check → Compliance Validation → Structured Output
Architecture Design Flow:
Requirements → Service Selection → Cost Analysis → 
Security Review → Performance Planning → Architecture Blueprint
Code Generation Flow:
Architecture → Template Selection → Code Generation → 
Security Scanning → Testing → Documentation → Package
4. Advanced Prompt Templates

Structured Reasoning Prompts:
Chain-of-thought reasoning
Multi-step analysis
Error checking and validation
Quality assurance
