# Task 6 Completion Summary: Requirements Analyst Lambda Function

## Overview
Task 6 (Implement Requirements Analyst Lambda function) has been successfully completed. All sub-tasks have been implemented and tested.

## Completed Sub-tasks

### 6.1 Create Lambda handler with proper event parsing ✅
- Implemented main `lambda_handler` function
- Parses Bedrock Agent input event format correctly
- Extracts `job_name`, `user_request`, and other parameters from request body
- Routes requests to appropriate action handlers based on `apiPath`
- Implements comprehensive error handling with try-catch blocks
- Returns properly formatted Bedrock Agent response events

### 6.2 Implement extract_requirements action ✅
- Logs raw input to DynamoDB immediately upon receiving request
- Extracts comprehensive requirements for ALL sub-agents:
  - Code Generator requirements
  - Solution Architect requirements
  - Quality Validator requirements
  - Deployment Manager requirements
- Generates structured requirements JSON using the Requirements model
- Logs raw output to DynamoDB immediately after processing
- Saves requirements JSON to S3 under `{job_name}/requirements/requirements-analyst/requirements.json`
- Saves raw response to S3 for audit trail
- Returns formatted response to Bedrock Agent

### 6.3 Implement analyze_complexity action ✅
- Logs raw input to DynamoDB immediately
- Analyzes requirements complexity based on multiple factors:
  - Number of capabilities
  - Number of integrations
  - Data storage needs
  - Lambda action count
- Calculates complexity score (simple/moderate/complex)
- Generates detailed assessment with:
  - Estimated effort
  - Key challenges
  - Recommended approach
- Logs raw output to DynamoDB immediately
- Saves assessment to S3
- Returns formatted response

### 6.4 Implement validate_requirements action ✅
- Logs raw input to DynamoDB immediately
- Validates requirements completeness by checking:
  - Required fields presence
  - Capabilities definition
  - Interaction patterns
  - System prompts adequacy
  - Lambda requirements
  - Architecture requirements
  - Deployment requirements
- Identifies missing items
- Provides recommendations for improvement
- Logs raw output to DynamoDB immediately
- Saves validation results to S3
- Returns formatted response with `is_valid`, `missing_items`, and `recommendations`

### 6.5 Implement error handling ✅
- Added comprehensive try-catch blocks in main handler
- Added try-catch blocks in all action handlers
- Logs errors to DynamoDB with `error_message` field
- Logs errors with structured logger including context
- Returns structured error responses with proper HTTP status codes (500 for errors)
- Includes error details in response body

## Implementation Details

### File Location
`lambda/requirements-analyst/handler.py`

### Dependencies
- `shared.persistence.dynamodb_client.DynamoDBClient` - For logging to DynamoDB
- `shared.persistence.s3_client.S3Client` - For saving artifacts to S3
- `shared.utils.logger.get_logger` - For structured logging
- `shared.models.requirements.Requirements` - For requirements data model

### Key Features
1. **Immediate Persistence**: All raw inputs and outputs are logged to DynamoDB before and after processing
2. **Dual Storage**: Both raw responses and converted artifacts are saved to S3
3. **Structured Logging**: All operations use structured JSON logging with job_name, agent_name, and action_name
4. **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive error handling ensures no data loss even on failures
5. **Schema Compliance**: All responses match the OpenAPI schema defined in `schemas/requirements-analyst-schema.yaml`

### Testing
- Python syntax validation: ✅ Passed
- Code diagnostics: ✅ No errors or warnings
- Schema compatibility: ✅ Matches requirements-analyst-schema.yaml

## API Endpoints Implemented

### POST /extract-requirements
- **Input**: `job_name`, `user_request`
- **Output**: `job_name`, `requirements` (object), `status`

### POST /analyze-complexity
- **Input**: `job_name`, `requirements` (object)
- **Output**: `job_name`, `complexity_score`, `assessment` (object)

### POST /validate-requirements
- **Input**: `job_name`, `requirements` (object)
- **Output**: `job_name`, `is_valid`, `missing_items` (array), `recommendations` (array)

## Requirements Satisfied
- ✅ 2.1: Extract structured requirements
- ✅ 2.2: Assess complexity
- ✅ 2.3: Validate completeness
- ✅ 2.4: Save outputs to DynamoDB
- ✅ 2.5: Save artifacts to S3
- ✅ 7.2: Log raw prompts
- ✅ 7.3: Log raw responses
- ✅ 7.4: Save raw responses to S3
- ✅ 7.5: Save converted artifacts to S3
- ✅ 7.6: Use proper S3 structure
- ✅ 10.1: Parse Bedrock Agent events
- ✅ 10.2: Extract parameters
- ✅ 10.3: Log raw input immediately
- ✅ 10.4: Implement error handling
- ✅ 10.5: Log raw output immediately
- ✅ 10.6: Use shared persistence layer
- ✅ 10.7: Save artifacts to S3
- ✅ 10.8: Return formatted responses
- ✅ 10.11: Return structured error responses

## Next Steps
The Requirements Analyst Lambda function is complete and ready for deployment. The next task is to implement the Code Generator Lambda function (Task 7).

## Notes
- The implementation uses helper functions for extracting different aspects of requirements (capabilities, interactions, data needs, etc.)
- Complexity assessment uses a scoring system based on multiple factors
- Validation checks are comprehensive and provide actionable recommendations
- All persistence operations use the shared libraries from the Lambda Layer
