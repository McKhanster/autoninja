# Rate Limiter Refactoring Summary

## Date
October 14, 2025

## Objective
Refactor `shared/utils/rate_limiter.py` to ensure a 30-second TOTAL interval per invocation, accounting for the actual call duration.

## Requirements
The interval should be 30 seconds TOTAL per invocation:
- If call takes 15 seconds â†’ wait another 15 seconds (total 30s)
- If call takes 29 seconds â†’ wait 1 second (total 30s)  
- If call takes 35 seconds â†’ don't wait (total 35s)

## Implementation

### Key Changes
1. **Updated Documentation**: Enhanced docstrings to clearly explain the TOTAL time behavior with examples
2. **Added Alias**: Created `BedrockRateLimiter = RateLimiter` for backward compatibility with existing tests
3. **Fixed Test Usage**: Corrected test to pass `start_time` instead of `call_duration` to `wait_if_needed()`

### Code Structure
```python
class RateLimiter:
    def wait_if_needed(self, operation_start_time: Optional[float] = None) -> float:
        """
        Wait if needed to ensure minimum total time since operation start.
        
        Examples:
            - Operation takes 15s: waits 15s (total 30s)
            - Operation takes 29s: waits 1s (total 30s)
            - Operation takes 35s: waits 0s (total 35s)
        """
        current_time = time.time()
        
        if operation_start_time is not None:
            elapsed = current_time - operation_start_time
            remaining = self.min_interval_seconds - elapsed
        # ... rest of logic
```

### Usage Pattern
```python
# Initialize rate limiter
rate_limiter = RateLimiter(min_interval_seconds=60)

# Make API call
start_time = time.time()
result = make_api_call()

# Wait remaining time to reach 60 seconds total
wait_time = rate_limiter.wait_if_needed(start_time)
print(f"Waited {wait_time:.1f} seconds")
```

## Testing Results

### Test Execution
Ran `tests/requirement_analyst/test_requirements_analyst_agent.py` with 60-second intervals:

```
Test 1: Extract Requirements
- Call duration: ~14 seconds
- Wait time: 46 seconds
- Total: 60 seconds âœ…

Test 2: Analyze Complexity  
- Call duration: ~17 seconds
- Wait time: 43 seconds
- Total: 60 seconds âœ…

Test 3: Validate Requirements
- Call duration: ~17 seconds
- Total: 60 seconds âœ…

Result: ðŸŽ‰ ALL TESTS PASSED!
```

## Files Modified
1. `shared/utils/rate_limiter.py` - Enhanced documentation and added alias
2. `tests/requirement_analyst/test_requirements_analyst_agent.py` - Fixed usage pattern
3. Lambda layer repackaged and uploaded to S3

## Benefits
- **Accurate Rate Limiting**: Ensures exact total time per operation
- **Efficient**: Minimizes unnecessary waiting when operations take longer
- **Flexible**: Works with variable operation durations
- **Backward Compatible**: Alias maintains compatibility with existing code

## Next Steps
Task 6 (Requirements Analyst Lambda) is now complete with proper rate limiting. Ready to proceed to Task 7 (Code Generator Lambda).
